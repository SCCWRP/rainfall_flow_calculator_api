### Rainfall Statistics

The total rainfall is the cumulative precipitation depth measured for each event. The average rainfall intensity is the ratio of the total rainfall to the total rainfall duration. The peak 5-min or 10-min rainfall intensity is given by the maximum depth of rainfall over any 5-min or 10-min interval, respectively. Precipitation statistics are calculated as: <br>


$$ P= \sum_{j=1}^{t_P / \Delta t}   P_j  $$

$$i_{ave}=\frac{P}{t_P} $$

$$i_{P5}=\max \left( \frac{\sum\limits_{i}^{(i+5)} P_i}{5-min} \right)$$
<div align="right"> 
Equation 3
</div>


Where P = total rainfall during an event (length, e.g., mm or in), $\Delta t$ = rain gauge data logging interval (e.g., min), $t_P$ = total rainfall duration, determined as the elapsed time from the first rain tip to the last rain tip (time), $i_{ave}$ = average rainfall intensity over the duration of the event (length/time), $P_5$ = 5-min precipitation depth (length), $i_{P5}$ = maximum rainfall intensity over a 5-min moving average (length/time).
